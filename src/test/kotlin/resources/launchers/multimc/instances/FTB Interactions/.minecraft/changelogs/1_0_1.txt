Critical Fix: Initial configs had wizardry mana pools not properly generating in the overworld. To correct this we  have moved the mana pool generation to COFH world and enabled retrogen. 
For servers that have already been pregenerated there maye be some small amount of tps hit while new pools are retrogenerated but we anticipate the impact to be minimal.
