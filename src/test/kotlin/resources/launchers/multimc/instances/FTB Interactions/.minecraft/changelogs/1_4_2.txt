Critical:
	* Melee attacks on blazes were crashing servers ever since their explosion ability was turned off - to temporarily fix this 

Minor: 
	* GTCE Pumps in Assembling machines now use 648 mb of molten metal instead of 628
	* Added Hazelnut to listAllnut oredict type



Server owners: This is an easy mini update if you're already on 1.4.1, 
you only need to update your resources and scripts folder, and config/ftbquest folders
all other config and mods remain unchanged
