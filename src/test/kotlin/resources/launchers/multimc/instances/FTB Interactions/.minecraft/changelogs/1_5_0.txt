Material Mod Updates
	Thaumic JEI 1.5.8 to 1.6.0
		If you don't have the research for a recipe, there will now be an icon in JEI warning you.

Quests:
	Some overworld mob quests required to kill 100 mobs instead of one. These tasks are mostly there for informative purposes.
	Quests to visit space, euclydes, and aurelia is a checkmark due to FTBQ dimensional detection issues.
		Dimensional staging trigger is still automatic.

Recipes:
	- Mekanism Liquid Oxygen/Hydrogen uses circuit configuration 5 instead of 1 to prevent conflict
	- Added Topaz, Red Garnet, Jasper to the squeezer and removed furnace smelting
	- Disabled Cyclic's new melter
	- Added porcelain faucet to clay kiln
	- added more basin dough recipes so order doesnt matter
	- nerfed pulerizing beacons so it doesn't output nether star dust

Misc:
	Modular Machinery
		- all craftable blueprints no longer require a blueprint in the controller (can still store it there)
		- machines with lootable only blueprints still require them in controller

		Mana Extrapolator:
			Hatches can be replaced by livingrock bricks, you can make an extrapolator with no hatches if you want but it will do nothing. No longer need at minimum 4 input/output mana/fluid hatches.

		Improved Coke Oven:
			Hatches are all interchangable and can be in any position. Still need a minimum of one item input, fluid output, and item output to do anything useful.

		Alchemical Matter Infuser
			Input/output busses are interchangable, once again you'll need a minimum of one input/output bus each to do anything.

	OreEx
		- add Topaz, Red Garnet, and Japser to the blacklist (gems in the copper gem veins)

	JEI
		- unhid liquid dirt clay bucket, empty clay bucket, and water clay bucket from JEI Blacklist
