1.9.0 Update
IMPORTANT: Any update from 1.8+ will cause Super factory managers to lose their programming due to a fundamental change in the way the mod handles data. 
The new change allows for higher numbers and stocking with the SFM and is a needed breaking change to improve the mod overall. Please make sure your players
have had a chance to copy down their programs to avoid any added hassle for this important update.
