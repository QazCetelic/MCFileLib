	"Once you have expanded your base a bit and returned from the nether, It's time to set up your first cobblegen. There are many different designs, however, to understand what you are trying to achieve when a lava stream comes into contact with flowing water, the lava will turn into cobblestone. Removing this piece of cobblestone allows the lava and water to flow together again forming another block of cobblestone. It is essential when designing your cobblegen to take steps to prevent the water from coming into direct contact with the lava source block. If flowing water meets still lava, the lava block will turn into obsidian and break the cobblegen completely."
