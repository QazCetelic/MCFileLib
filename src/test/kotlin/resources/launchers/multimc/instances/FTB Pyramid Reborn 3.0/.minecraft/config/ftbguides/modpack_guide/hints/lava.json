	"At the beginning of the game you are gifted a bucket of lava. Here you have a choice that will affect your progress. You can either choose to make a manual cobblegen early on which whilst more complicated will allow you to preserve your lava, or you can use your lava bucket up to make a tier 1 cobble generator. This method whilst much simpler early on uses up your lava. This will force you to look for an alternative source of lava later on down the line. There is however a way to make further lava with a bit of extra infrastructure. Tracing back recipes from a lava bucket will help you out."
