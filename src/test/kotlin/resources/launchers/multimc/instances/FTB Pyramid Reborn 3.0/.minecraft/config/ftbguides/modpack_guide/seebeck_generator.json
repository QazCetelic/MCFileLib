	"At the start of the game, you will have a limited ability to create any type of energy. To help you out we have created the Seebeck Generator. When placed in the world it will take the heat generated from a lit furnace and convert that heat directly into RF power and feed that into the ResGen. Each furnace directly connected to the Seebeck Generator will increase the amount of energy produced."
